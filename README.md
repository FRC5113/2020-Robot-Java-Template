# 2020-Robot-Java-Template
 

Hi to whomever's reading this, probably someone on FRC 5113, the Combustible Lemons. 
My name's Vinay, and I was the lead of Software on the team for two years, and the
co-president for one. I really enjoyed robotics when I was part of the team, and 
I'm going to make sure to properly comment this template and explain everything 
that's in it. This is only going to have drivetrain code, at least how it was 
written when I was part of the team. Good luck lemon. Hope you add to the team.
